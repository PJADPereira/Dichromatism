# Introduction

This repository summarizes all the code and command line calls used to execute all the analysis present in Gazda et al. in review.

Four different files and five python scripts can be found here.

[nanopore.md](./nanopore.md): This file contains a guide for the methodologies used with nanopore data.

[transcriptomics.md](./transcriptomics.md): This file contains a guide for the methodologies used for transcriptome assemblies.

[pool-seq.md](./pool-seq.md) This file contains a guide for the methodologies used to analyse whole-genome re-sequencing data.

[differential_expression](./differential_expression.md) This file contains a guide for the methodologies used for differential expression analysis. 

[src](./src/) The source folder contains python scripts used in the differential expression analysis. See [differential_expression](./differential_expression.md) for more information on how to use them.
